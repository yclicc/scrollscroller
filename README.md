# ScrollScroller 
ScrollScroller is a data visualisation of the whole Bible with links to BibleGateway when a chapter is clicked on. You can view it [here](https://yclicc.github.io/scrollscroller/). For documentation of the dataset behind it, see the data folder above.

### Usage
Move your mouse (if using mobile (not recommended) you have to click) over the chart at the top to zoom in on a portion of the Bible. In the chart below, click on a chapter to open it in BibleGateway or use ctrl-click to open BibleGateway in a new tab. 

You can select one (or more) translations to view by modifying the text field at the bottom. For example, "NIVUK,CCB,JLB" will open parallel New International Version (Anglicised), Chinese Contemporary Bible and Japanese Living Bible when clicking a chapter. 

There is also a dropdown to choose between the traditional Christian order of the Old Testament and the Hebrew TaNaKh ordering (with Torah first, then Prophets, then Psalms/Writings). This alternative ordering would have been more familiar to Jesus and his early followers (for example, Matthew 23:35 then refers to the first and last prophets killed in the Old Testament, using this order with 2 Chronicles at the end).
